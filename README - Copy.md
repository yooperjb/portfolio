## Description 

Horiseon demonstrates a basic website design using a single HTML page, and one external CSS file. The HTML follows semantic element structure using elements such as \<article>, \<header>, \<footer>, \<section>, and \<nav>. Semantic elements are important in website accessibility because they more clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. 

The website contains a header which includes navigation links pointing to sections in the main body of the page. The section includes articles which are similar looking components of the page demonstrating the services Horiseon provides. 

To grab the attention of visitors, the page prominently displays a large central image, or hero, which clearly shows Horiseon employees hard at work. Images located in the services section also meet web accessibility standards by clearly describing each in the *alt* tag.
