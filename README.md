# Jason Barnes Portfolio

## Description 
Herein lies a portfolio of my past and current projects. This particular website displays my skills in HTML and advanced CSS using layout techniques such as FLEX and GRID. It also demonstrates the use of advanced hover techniques and animations. 

This website is also a responsive design and adapts to multiple screen sizes and devices. It aims to provide easy navigation and readability for all devices including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. It completes this through the use of CSS media queries which identifies the device in use, and dynamically alters the website for the best user experience. 

The website can be viewed at [https://yooperjb.github.io/portfolio/](https://yooperjb.github.io/portfolio/).
